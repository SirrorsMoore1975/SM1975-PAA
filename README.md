# Introduction
## What is Phone-Review-App?

Phone-Review-App is a project that collect user's review over Japanese main phone carrier. Users can provider their view of each of the carrier they might have experienced.

## How to set up the project in local machine
### For development
1. create `.env` and copy contents in `.env.example`, replace the field for `DB_NAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`, make note to the name use.
1. run `psql` and create a database associate with the `DB_NAME`
1. `npm run build` to install client's (React) and server's dependancy, if you have created the database, the knex migration and seed should work; but in case this fail, you can do migration using `npm run migrate` and seed using `npm run seed`;
1. run the program using `npm run start`


# The Frontend

## client/src/index.js
This file contains the routes and the client side endpoints for each separate page

### Components
`AvgScores` - displays all of the average scores on the carrier profile pages (the pink card)  

`Button` - a template for most of the buttons on the app 

`Card` - the cards that are displayed for each carrier on the Homepage  

***`Dropdown Menu`*** - the dropdown menu that allows user to select which carrier they are reviewing on the `Provider` page. (<i>WIP</i>-  [#31](https://github.com/SirrorsMoore1975/SM1975-PAA/issues/31) )

`Footer` - the footer that is displayed on all pages 

`Header` - the header that is displayed on the Homepage and the thank you message after submission 

`Input` - a template for the input fields on the Forms page 

`Navbar` - alternate version of the Header component; this one has a home button in the upper right corner 

`ProviderInfo` - displays the hero at the top of each carrier profile page

***`ProviderInfoNavBar`*** - provide components to navigate between carrier without first going back to the home page. Use the arrow key to navigate between the Provider Page and a new dropdown menu to change provider page ([#15](https://github.com/SirrorsMoore1975/SM1975-PAA/issues/15))

`Radio` - Score system for user to choose 0 - 10

`ReviewCard` - The components to show the average result score users has given

### Pages
***`ErrorPage`*** - dummy page for development purpose only

`Homepage` - the homepage; this is the root path ("/"). 

***`Provider`*** - the page which display the provider info and its average scores.

`ReviewForm` - the page where the user will input their scores and write their review.

***`ThankYou`*** - the page that say thank you when review has successfully added.

Additonally, there is a page for each of the nine carriers and a `Provider.css` page for styling these pages.  

### provider.json
provider.json consist of `provider_id`, `value`, `text` and `path`:
```json
[
    {
        "provider_id":1,
        "value":"Mobal",
        "text":"Mobal",
        "path":"/mobal"
    },
    {},
]
```
The problem is that, both the server and client are using the same data/provider.json to do their coding. This should change with an update to issue [#27](https://github.com/SirrorsMoore1975/SM1975-PAA/issues/27).

### How does Radio.jsx run
The following is the code inside Radio.jsx. 
```jsx
<span className={className}>
   {input.value}
    <br />
   <label htmlFor={label} 
      key={index}>
                        
      <input 
        id={label}
        type={input.type}
        name={radioName}
        value={input.value}
        checked={isRadioSelected(input.value)}
        onChange={handleRadioSelect}
        >
        </input>
        </label>
```
```jsx
<Radio 
  className={P:string} 
  label={Q:string} 
  radioName={R:string} 
  scoreSetter={S:function}
  />
```

`radioName` is the radio name for all those name for radio, in this example, it is bob

React in radio button uses a boolean method call `checked` to determine which buttons in the radio set are selected.
```jsx

<input checked={ true } name="bob" value="0">{ /* commercial secret */ }</input>

<input checked={ false } name="bob" value="1">{ /* commercial secret */ }</input>

<input checked={ false } name="bob" value="2">{ /* commercial secret */ }</input>
```
We have a `useState` that default the selected button to 0 score. And the same `useState` has function to change that selected button value. 
```jsx
const [selectRadioButton, setSelectRadioButton] = useState(‘0’);
```
Another function ,`isRadioSelected`, is created to determine true/false by comparing the current value and the `useState` variable. 
```jsx
const isRadioSelected = (value) => selectRadioButton === value
```
This `isRadioSelected` function is placed on each button and linked to each button’s `checked` . When the `useState` function changes value (ie. user changing its score), the `isRadioSelected` return false, which make current button checked become false and since the value at the selected button is that given value, this make isRadioSelected which pointed to button checked became true.
We used another function which handle Radio select (`handleRadioSelect`).
```jsx
const handleRadioSelect = (event) => setSelectRadioButton(event.target.value);
```

When radio button is changed, `selectRadioButton` changes as `onChange` is linked to `handleRadioSelect`. Every button has this function at `onChange`, so when a button status change, it will follows:

```html
<input checked={isRadioSelected(input.value)} onChange={handleRadioSelect} />
```

When user decided to select other score, the function changed useState variable `selectRadioButton`, thereby causing previous selected button checked become false, the user now selected button has `checked` become true.

# The Backend 

## API endpoints
The express server contains 4 /api endpoints, though one is just used for testing ('/api/hello').

### /api/providers

This endpoint requires no inputs. This endpoint queries the Database for the seeded provider data and the overall scores from the review_detail table. At the moment, we only have 9 providers, but it could be generalized to take in an id value and query for any number of providers.

The endpoint `return`s (`res.send()`) back an array of objects, where each object contains the following keys (id, name, img_url, description, english_support, site_url, overall).

`id` (integer) is the id value the provider has in the provider table.  
`name` (string) is the name of the provider.  
`img_url` (string) is a img address to the providers logo. 
`description` (string) is roughly a paragraph description of the provider.  
`english_support` (boolean) is a value as to if the company provides English customer support.  
`site_url` (string) in the url for the providers website (English page if available). 
`overall` (float rounded to 2 decimal places) is the average of all overall scores of that provider.  

example:
```jsx
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Mobal",
    "img_url": "https://www.mobal.com/img/common/logo.svg",
    "description": "A US based company that offers Japanese and International sim plans for both long-term and short-term stays. Mobal guarantees that the majority of their profits go to charity. They also offer complete English-speaking support. They also offer a home wifi plan with a mobile hotspot plan.",
    "english_support": true,
    "site_url": "https://www.mobal.com/",
    "overall": 5.71
  },
  ...
]
```

### /api/provider/:providerid
This endpoint requires the providerid parameter as a number (1-9). This number corrolates to the providers location in the provider table.

This endpoint returns an array of two values
[providerInfo, reviews]
where:
providerInfo is an object 
reviews is an array of review objects.

The first element (providerInfo) has all the same keys as in /api/providers, as well as (ease_of_use, coverage, price, customer_service). Each of these keys are the average scores of their respective reviewer criteria.

reviews is an array of objects where each object contains the following keys (reviewer_name, overall, ease_of_use, coverage, price, customer_service,customer_review).

`reviewer_name` (string) is the name of the reviewer to display. 
`overall` (number) is the reviewer's overall score. 
`ease_of_use` (number) is the reviewer's Ease of Use score. 
`coverage` (number) is the reviewer's coverage score. 
`price` (number) is the reviewer's price score. 
`customer_service` (number) is the reviewer's customer service score. 
`customer_review` (string) is the reviews written review of the company.  

### /api/review 
This endpoint is to add a new customers review. This endpoint takes the review in the body, test if that email had been used prior to review that company, and if it hasn't adds it to the database.

This endpoint expects the body to contain the following information:
`provider_id` (number) 
`reviewer_name` (string) 
`email` (string) 
`overall` (number) 
`ease_of_use` (number) 
`coverage` (number) 
`price` (number) 
`customer_service` (number) 
`customer_review` (string) 

example body:
```jsx
{
    "provider_id":2,
    "reviewer_name": "Todd Rogers",
    "email": "godslayerXD@hotmail.com",
    "overall": 8,
    "ease_of_use": 6,
    "coverage": 9,
    "price": 7,
    "customer_service": 9,
    "customer_review": "Creating an account and getting the SIM card is a little annoying, and once you put the SIM card in your phone, there is a bit of annoyance in setting up the data plan on your phone. However, once you finish the setup, I haven't had an issue with the server and everytime I contacted customer service, my issue was quickly addressed."
}
```
